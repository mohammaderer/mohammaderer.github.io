      <p className="py-4 text-xl">Academics work best when they work (and play) together. Access to people and ideas is critical to a researcher’s success. Such access often needs accepted papers to (eg.) conferences. So we need some way, without accepted papers, that how can junior researchers build their personnel and professional network. At ESSEC, student researchers will be invited to give brief presentations on their work as well as join affinity groups and attend panels that explore a wide range of professional and personal issues in academia.</p>
